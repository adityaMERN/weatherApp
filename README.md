# weatherApp
This is a full stack application which uses html,css javascript for front-end.For back-end I have used express.
The web app is deployed on heroku and the link is :  https://temp-app-aditya.herokuapp.com/
I have use handlebars to create templates for various fields and used bootstrap to make it fully responsive.
In future I will add another functionality that will show the current time in any city along with the weather conditions there.Right now it will is fully working to give weather forecast of any city around the world.
